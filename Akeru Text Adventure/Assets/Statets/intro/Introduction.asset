  storyText: Welcome to the airship Akeru. One of the last ships capable of descending
    below the corona, the thick haze that now covers the surface. Nobody knows why
    the Carona formed, some say it was the result of the experiments of men, other
    the natural defence of the planate below in response to man's disregard for it.
    Whatever the case the one thing that everyone can agree on is that things lurk
    in the corona. Things only seen in the storybooks of old. Many have tried to venture
    below the corona, very few have returned. Now it is your turn Adventurer. Perhaps
    you will succeed where so many have failed. Good look.
